# Flight Difficulty Score SQL Project

### 📘 Overview
This project analyzes flight management complexity using SQL.  
Five datasets (flight_level_data, bag_level_data, , pnr_remark_data, etc.) were merged and processed to calculate a **Difficulty Score** indicating how hard each flight is to manage.

### 📊 Files
- [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XRylAKMG-1d0xvIyGD2bqGQS8PynU2VA?usp=sharing) → contains all CSV datasets 
- [flight_difficulty_score.sql](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22760095/flight_difficulty_score.sql) → SQL query
- [flight_difficluty_score.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22760164/flight_difficluty_score.csv) → final output



### 🧠 Key Insights
- Flights with more special service requests ,lap child and transfers had higher difficulty scores.
- SQL window functions and joins were used for aggregation.

### ⚙️ Tools Used
- MySQL 

### 🧩 How to Run
1. Import all CSVs into your SQL environment.
2. Run queries from [flight_difficulty_score.sql](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22760095/flight_difficulty_score.sql).
3. Export the result to [flight_difficluty_score.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22760164/flight_difficluty_score.csv).
